# Pushing All Changes to GitHub

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your repository's root:

   ```
   cd "C:/Users/shant/OneDrive/Desktop/Socio-Scan"
   ```

2. Stage all changes (modified and untracked files):

   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

   ```
   git commit -m "Update ProfilePage and other files with resume changes and file name display"
   ```

4. Push the commit to your GitHub repository (ensure you're pushing to the correct branch):
   ```
   git push origin master
   ```

Follow these steps to have your changes updated in your repository.
