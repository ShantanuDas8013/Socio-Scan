# Handling the esbuild Vulnerability

Dependabot has flagged an issue with `esbuild` because no non-vulnerable version is compatible with your current dependencies:

- **vite@5.4.14** requires `esbuild@^0.21.3`
- **@vitejs/plugin-react@4.2.1** requires `esbuild@^0.21.3` (via vite)
- The earliest fixed version is **0.25.0**, which conflicts with existing dependency requirements.

## Options

1. **Wait for an Update:**  
   Monitor the releases for [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) to see when they update their dependency requirements to support a fixed version of esbuild.

2. **Override the esbuild Version (Temporary Workaround):**  
   If you are using **Yarn**, you can add a `resolutions` field in your `package.json` to force the use of a higher version. For example:

   ```json
   // ...existing package.json...
   "resolutions": {
     "esbuild": "0.25.0"
   }
   ```

   Then run:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

   > **Note:** This workaround may lead to unexpected behavior if the forced version is not fully compatible.

   For **npm**, consider using the [npm-force-resolutions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-force-resolutions) package to achieve similar behavior.

3. **Suppress the Alert:**  
   If the vulnerability does not impact your usage (or you have evaluated the risks), you can choose to ignore it temporarily until a proper upgrade path is available.

## Recommendation

Ideally, wait for the official updates from Vite and its plugins. If an immediate fix is required, evaluate the override option carefully while testing your application thoroughly.

Refer to the respective repositories or security advisories for more details.
