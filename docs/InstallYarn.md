# Installing Yarn

It appears that the `yarn` command is not recognized. To install Yarn, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download Node.js (which includes npm) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Install Yarn globally using npm. Open your terminal and run:

   ```
   npm install --global yarn
   ```

3. After installation, verify that Yarn is installed by running:

   ```
   yarn --version
   ```

4. Once installed, navigate back to your project directory and run:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

These steps should enable you to use Yarn commands on your system.
